THE ULTIMATE TRADER’S GUIDE
Based on the TJR Trading Curriculum
PART I: THE FUNDAMENTALS
Before applying strategy, you must understand the language of the chart.
1. Candlestick Anatomy
Timeframes: Each candle represents a specific amount of time (1m, 5m, 1H, 4H, Daily).
The Body: Represents the open and close price. It shows conviction.
The Wicks: Represents the High and Low of that time period. Wicks show price history, "snail trails," and potential rejection.
The Logic: A candle opening, moving down (leaving a wick), moving up, and closing high indicates buyers took control.
2. Highs and Lows (Market Structure)
Swing High: A three-candle formation where the middle candle has a higher high than the candles to its immediate left and right. (Simplified: Move Up -> Move Down).
Swing Low: A three-candle formation where the middle candle has a lower low than the candles to its immediate left and right. (Simplified: Move Down -> Move Up).
Identifying Trends:
Uptrend: Series of Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).
Downtrend: Series of Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL).
Consolidation: Sideways movement with no clear direction.
3. Break of Structure (BOS)
Definition: When a candle body closes past a previous Swing High (in an uptrend) or Swing Low (in a downtrend).
Significance: This confirms the continuation or shift of a trend.
Uptrend: Low gets closed underneath = Shift to Bearish.
Downtrend: High gets closed above = Shift to Bullish.
PART II: THE TOOLBOX (CONFLUENCES)
These are the specific tools used to identify entries and targets. Never use one in isolation; combine them for high probability.
1. Liquidity
What is it? Resting orders (Stop Losses, Buy Stops, Sell Stops). It is the fuel that moves the market.
Where is it?
Above Highs: Buy Stops (Liquidity for sellers).
Below Lows: Sell Stops (Liquidity for buyers).
The Logic: The "Smart Money" needs to trigger these stops to fill their large orders. We look for Liquidity Sweeps (price pokes a high/low and reverses) to enter trades.
2. Fair Value Gaps (FVG) / Imbalances
Definition: A three-candle pattern where the first candle’s wick and the third candle’s wick do not overlap, leaving a gap in the middle candle.
Bullish FVG: Gap between Candle 1 High and Candle 3 Low. (Indicates lack of sell orders).
Bearish FVG: Gap between Candle 1 Low and Candle 3 High. (Indicates lack of buy orders).
Usage: These act as magnets. Price often returns to these gaps to "balance" the inefficiency before continuing.
3. Order Blocks (OB)
Definition: A price range where large institutional orders were filled, causing a market shift.
Identification:
Bullish OB: The last down move (leg) prior to a liquidity sweep and a Break of Structure (BOS) up.
Bearish OB: The last up move (leg) prior to a liquidity sweep and a Break of Structure (BOS) down.
Usage: If price returns to this block, we expect a reaction in the original direction.
4. Equilibrium (Premium vs. Discount)
Definition: The 50% point of a price swing (from Swing High to Swing Low).
Tool: Use the Gann Box or Fib Retracement.
Usage:
Discount (Below 50%): Only look to BUY here.
Premium (Above 50%): Only look to SELL here.
5. Breaker Blocks
Definition: A "failed" Order Block. A support zone that broke and became resistance (or vice versa).
Bullish Breaker: Low 
→
→
 High 
→
→
 Lower Low. The up-move (High) that was broken through becomes a Bullish Breaker.
Bearish Breaker: High 
→
→
 Low 
→
→
 Higher High. The down-move (Low) that was broken through becomes a Bearish Breaker.
6. Balanced Price Range (BPR)
Definition: Overlapping Bullish and Bearish Fair Value Gaps.
Logic: If price aggressively moves up (leaving a Bullish FVG) and then immediately aggressively moves down (leaving a Bearish FVG) through the same area, the overlap is a high-probability reversal zone.
7. SMT Divergence
Definition: A "crack" in correlation between correlated assets (e.g., ES/S&P500 and NQ/Nasdaq).
Bullish SMT: One asset makes a Lower Low, while the other makes a Higher Low. (The one making a Higher Low shows strength).
Bearish SMT: One asset makes a Higher High, while the other makes a Lower High.
Usage: Use this to confirm reversals at key levels.
PART III: THE SYSTEMIZED STRATEGY (Futures/Indices)
This is the step-by-step flowchart for taking a trade. Do not deviate.
Step 1: Establish Daily Bias (The "Setup")
Check 4-Hour Trend: Is it Bullish or Bearish? This is your overall bias.
Check 1-Hour Trend:
If 1H matches 4H 
→
→
 You will look for entries on the 5-minute.
If 1H opposes 4H (Retracement) 
→
→
 You will look for entries on the 15-minute.
Step 2: The Wait (Pre-Market/Opening)
Identify Draws on Liquidity: Mark out 1H and 4H Highs and Lows.
Identify HTF Confluences: Mark out 1H and 4H Order Blocks or FVGs.
The Rule: Sit on your hands. Do nothing until price sweeps a HTF Liquidity level or taps a HTF Confluence (OB/FVG).
Step 3: The Execution (Lower Timeframe)
Once the HTF level from Step 2 is hit, drop to your execution timeframe (5m or 15m as determined in Step 1).
The Entry Checklist:
Liquidity Sweep: Did we just sweep a high/low? (Yes).
Break of Structure (BOS): Wait for a candle body closure in the opposite direction on the execution timeframe.
The Return: Wait for price to return to a "Third Confluence" created by that BOS move:
Fair Value Gap (FVG)
Order Block
Breaker Block
Equilibrium
The Trigger:
Option A: Enter on the touch of the confluence.
Option B (Safer): Wait for a candle color change (e.g., green candle closing out of a bullish FVG).
Option C (Precision): Drop one timeframe lower (e.g., 5m 
→
→
 1m) and wait for a 1m BOS inside the 5m confluence.
PART IV: TRADE MANAGEMENT
Stop Loss (SL) Placement
Safest: Above/Below the Liquidity Sweep (The invalidation point).
Aggressive: Above/Below the Entry Confluence (e.g., the FVG or Order Block).
Risky: Above/Below the high/low formed within the confluence.
Take Profit (TP) Strategies
Don't Guess: Target opposing logical points where price might reverse.
Targets:
Opposing Liquidity (Old Highs/Lows).
Opposing Order Blocks or FVGs.
Always aim for HTF (1H/4H) targets if trading with the trend.
Rule: Never extend TPs. You can move SL to breakeven, but do not get greedy with TPs.
PART V: THE FOREX STRATEGY (Session Plays)
A specific variation for Forex pairs (like GBPJPY or GBPUSD).
Concept: Use Session Highs/Lows as support/resistance and liquidity pools.
Mark Session Times:
Asian Open (8:00 PM EST)
London Open (3:00 AM EST)
New York Open (8:00 AM EST)
Mark Session Highs/Lows: On the 30-minute timeframe, draw a box/line at the High and Low of the previous session (e.g., during NY, look at London Highs/Lows).
The Trade:
Wait for price to sweep/tap a previous Session High or Low.
Drop to 5-minute.
Wait for BOS + Confluence (FVG/OB/Breaker).
Target: The opposing Session High/Low (e.g., if you sweep London Low and buy, target London High).
PART VI: PSYCHOLOGY & RULES
Systemize or Fail: If you change your strategy every day, you cannot track what works. Stick to the 4H/1H 
→
→
 5m/15m system.
Journaling: You must record trades to know your probabilities. "I lose 80% of trades on Order Blocks, so I will stop using them."
Risk Management: Use Stop Losses to prevent catastrophe.
Patience: The "Hands in Ass" technique. Do not trade until your specific conditions (HTF Sweep + LTF BOS) are met. If they don't happen, do not trade.
Cherry Picking: Not every FVG or OB works. They only work when combined with Liquidity Sweeps and Structure (Context).
