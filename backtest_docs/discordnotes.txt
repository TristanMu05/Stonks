@everyone  Daily Analysis Jan 12th
4hr Timeframe:
● Rejected off the resistance level last night and pushed to make a move lower. Failed to take previous AM lows and showed a decent sized rejection from there. Left a big 4hr FVG above current price so I would like to see price tap back into it and then give a signal on the daily direction
1hr Timeframe:
● Same thing as the 4hr but it left a higher imbalance above Asia highs, if it wants to go lower I would again like to see those tapped or the range rebalanced before it goes. If it disrespects them we are moving higher once again lol
30min Timeframe:
● The higher timeframe trend is definitely bearish but we did just build bullish structure. I am going to be patient in waiting to see which high timeframe range gets rebalanced first and then price will potentially move that direction for the first part of the day
Overall:
● Again we are close to All time highs on ES so it is hard to go with a bearish bias until we break through so key levels.
● Patience is always going to be key but wait for price to rebalance and reject off a range before taking any trades today.

@everyone Daily Analysis Jan 13th

4hr timeframe:
Left a massive gap that this morning has already tapped into and this resistance level is still holding but I think there might be enough pressure to break through it today and finally get to 26,101 before we can see rejection. Again if we cannot break past these highs on NQ we will FINALLY go lower for the day

1hr timeframe:
Same thing as the 4hr hour, right now we are in bullish structure (breaking past previous highs) Yesterdays move left a massive gap that has just got tapped into once but not tapping the CE which makes me think the next time we go there  it will be straight through it

30min timeframe:
Still in a bullish trend and I would like to see us go to 26,101 area before we can see a reversal back down to True Day Open and possibly Asia lows

Overall:
NQ’s level is resistance is holding really well but I we can push up to 26,101 before we come back down. If the highs holds it would be great to see us finally balance out a little bit of this big move up that we have had. 
Bullish until 26,101 then bearish based on order flow. If we cannot break past the highs I would want to see it balance out yesterday’s move. Remember, take what the market gives you not what you “want to” happen

Targets:
26,101
True Day Open
Asia Lows
Previous AM lows
    •        ⁃    Previous London Lows

@everyone Daily Analysis Jan 14th
4hr Timeframe:
Made a massive dump in post Asia and in London session today and didn’t really leave anymore gaps to fills so we can finally see a NY continuation but first we will usually see manipulation before the move lower
Now if we can get to the volume imbalance today that would be sick

1hr Timeframe
We did get 2 HTF FVG’s and currently rejecting off of the first one of them which signals we can go lower, ideally we would come up to the second one, reject off that and then make a bigger move lower
And that would pretty much balance out this entire move down

30min timeframe:
The only daily target we have left are London highs, Asia highs, true day open, and previous London lows (jan 12th)
It would not surprise me if we come back up to true day open, pushing past London highs and then continue lower to break those jan 12th London lows. We have a higher timeframe structure forming on the 30min timeframe to continue higher.


Overall: 
This looks like a typical NY continuation but when we have continuations in the beginning of NY AM we will usually see a manipulation first, so have patience this morning. We have gone up for so long I would like to see price just continue all day bearish and fill a lot of the gaps it has made on this move up. 

Targets:
True Day Open
Current London Highs
Current Asia Highs
Jan 12th London Lows
25,887
25,587
25,514
    •        ⁃    Volume Imbalance at 25,413
A daily plan for trading is incredibly important. 4 of the targets today were hit and some of them were very far down. 

If you don’t have a daily trading plan check this out and if you have any questions on “why” those are targets, make sure to ask one of us and we will help you!

4hr Timeframe:
What goes down fast must come up fast. Now we have a balanced price range, inversing each others FVG’s. We left several 4hr FVG’s lows and are currently at .786 of the entire down move. This looks like another NY continuation bullish but I would like to see us tap into the HTF FVG’s and the. Show us a direction

1hr Timeframe: 
Same as the 4hr timeframe but leaving even more imbalances in price. Before we have any kind of pull back NQ will probably take the news highs at 26,044 and we can see potential structure built around 26,101 if it doesn’t build structure just right there

30min Timeframe:
Right now we just swept both of the previous targets (London high, Asia high) - Same thing as the 1hr and 4hr 
Today we are going to take what price gives us and since we are so close to all time highs I would like to see ES take those again and reach up to 7,044

Overall:
Be patient and take what price gives us today - right now we potentially have NY continuation unless price wants to balance this out before it moves higher. 

Bullish Targets: NQ 
26,101
Jan 26th Highs (26,044)
Jan 26th Lunch Highs

Bearish Targets: NQ
25,722
London Lows

@everyone Daily Analysis Jan 16th
4hr Timeframe:
Made a push up from yesterday close, probably going to push up to that 4hr no wick bearish candle
Still did not fill all gaps below but filled enough that we could see a continuation higher (because of ES)
Friday we usually dump though

1hr Timeframe:
Looks like we have rejected the 1hr FVG’s that were made last night so we can definitely see a move higher too potentially see what we wanted with yesterday’s targets
I know I say be patient a lot but you don’t have to get the BIGGEST trade on market open everyday, sometimes you have to wait for a good setup like yesterday in the PM session

30min timeframe:
Def can see us going lower after taking this no wick 4hr candle
High timeframe structure played out very well yesterday so when you see that wait for the traceback into .618
Good area of possible structure is 25,900

Bullish Targets:
No wick 4hr candle (25,885)
Previous PM Highs
Previous Lunch Highs
Previous NY AM Highs
25,900
26,047
26101

Bearish Targets

Bearish Targets 
25,131
25,030
Post London Session Lows

Bullish Targets
True Day Open
London Highs
Asia Highs
NWOG CE

4hr Timeframe:
Left a big NWOG we have not tapped back into and have had a lot of bearish pressure down so I can see us manipulation down, sweeping Post session london lows, and possibly a previous 4hr FVG then coming back up to true day

1hr Timeframe:
Balanced the most recent previous bearish move at .618 of the hourly range so def can see it go a little lower

30min timeframe:
The most realistic targets today would be taking out the lows made post London then pulling back to True day open.

Overall: Going a little lower and possibly filling a previous 4hr FVG then heading back up to true day open and possibly London highs

@everyone Daily Analysis Jan 20th

4hr Timeframe:
Currently in a bearish trend on the newest 4hr candle we are in about .5 of the entire range. Yesterday’s move balanced perfectly at .618 before it went lower. 
At the bottom of this recent move we rejected off a previous 4hr FVG but I would like to see the second on get hit at 25,030

1hr Timeframe:
On the most recent leg down we made 2 HTF FVG’s and have inverted the first one. I would like to see what we do off the second one before we get a daily direction. 

30min Timeframe
Very similar to the 1hr timeframe but you can see our targets. This looks very similar to what we had yesterday but on Tuesdays we establish the first real trend

Overall:
This looks like a NY continuation and on Tuesday’s we establish the first real trend. I would like to see London Highs and true day open get hit while respecting the 1hr FVG at 25,343. Then a big push down to 25,030. 
If we close over 25,343 then we can keep pushing higher

Bullish Targets:
London Highs
25,343
True Day Open
Asia Highs

Bearish Targets
London Lows
25,030
December 18th London Lows
December 18th Asia Lows

the Confidence Interval Strategy.
Executive Summary
The core philosophy of this strategy is Dynamic Risk Management. Instead of risking the same amount on every single trade, you adjust your leverage (position size) and your trade management rules based on how confident you are in the setup. This allows a trader to experiment and "forward test" with real money without blowing an account, while maximizing profits on "A+" setups.
1. The Core Framework: The Confidence Scale
The speaker uses a 50k Prop Account as the baseline for these calculations. The strategy requires you to rate every potential trade on a scale of 1 to 10 before entering.
Tier 1: Low Confidence (The "Testing" Phase)
Rating: 1 to 3
Use Case: You are testing a new strategy, gathering information, or forward-testing a setup where you want "skin in the game" to feel the psychology, but the technicals are not perfect.
Position Size: 1 to 2 Micros.
Risk Profile: extremely low risk. Do not be an "idiot" and risk full leverage here.
Expectations: Do not expect a home run (500+ ticks). You are looking for a quick scalp or confirmation.
Target (R:R): 1:2 Risk-to-Reward ratio.
Tier 2: Medium Confidence (The "Standard" Trade)
Rating: 4 to 6
Use Case: A solid structural trade. It has good confluence, but it isn't perfect. It might be a "B" or "C" grade setup. You believe it will work, but you aren't willing to bet the house on it.
Position Size: 3 to 6 Micros.
Target (R:R): 1:3 or 1:4 Risk-to-Reward ratio.
Tier 3: High Confidence (The "A+" Setup)
Rating: 7 to 10
Use Case: The "A+" setup. High confluence, aligns with your best strategy, and everything suggests it will go your way. If this trade fails, it’s simply a probability outlier.
Position Size: 7 to 10 Micros (or 1–2 Minis).
Target (R:R): 1:4 Risk-to-Reward ratio plus runners.
2. Trade Management Rules
The strategy changes how you manage the trade (Break Even & Take Profit) based on the tier.
The Universal Rule: Every trade uses a 50-tick Stop Loss.
Break Even (BE) Rules:
Low Confidence: Move to Break Even quickly.
Trigger: When the trade is up 50 to 65 ticks.
Why: You don't trust this trade fully. If it moves a bit and comes back, get out. Don't let a test trade become a loss.
High Confidence: Move to Break Even slowly.
Trigger: When the trade is up 100 ticks.
Why: You trust the setup. You need to give an A+ setup "breathing room" to fluctuate without wicked you out before the big move.
Take Profit (TP) & Runners:
Low/Medium Confidence: Hard exits. Hit your 1:2 or 1:3 target and close the full position.
High Confidence: Scale out and leave runners.
Execution: At the 1:4 target, close 30% to 50% of the position (e.g., if holding 10 micros, close 3-5 of them).
Runner Management: Leave the remaining micros to run to significantly higher targets, while locking the Stop Loss in profit to ensure the trade is a winner regardless of what happens next.
3. Implementation Checklist
To implement this tomorrow, follow this flowchart for every trade alert:
Spot the Setup: Identify a potential entry.
Rate the Setup (1-10):
Is this an experiment? -> Low (1-3)
Is this a standard decent setup? -> Medium (4-6)
Is this an A+ snipe? -> High (7-10)
Size the Position:
Low: 1-2 Micros.
Med: 3-6 Micros.
High: 7-10 Micros.
Set the Bracket:
Stop Loss: 50 Ticks (Fixed).
Take Profit: Adjust based on tier (1:2 for low, 1:4+ for high).
Manage the Trade:
If Low Confidence: Move Stop to Break Even as soon as you see +50 ticks.
If High Confidence: Wait for +100 ticks before moving Stop to Break Even.
Why use this strategy?
Prevents Blowouts: You will never blow an account testing a new theory because you are only using 1 micro.
Psychological Data: Forward testing with 1 micro is better than "paper trading" because you still feel real emotions (Greed/Fear), but the financial damage is negligible.
Maximizes Winners: By going heavy only on A+ setups and letting runners ride, one big win can cover many small "testing" losses.
